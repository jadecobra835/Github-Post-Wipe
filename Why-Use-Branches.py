# Branches are usualy used when the change you need to implement isn't just a quick fix.
# If you don't want to make all of the changes necessary on the live website, that's when you want to use branches.
# Branches are usually called Feature Branches becuase of this.
# This allows everyone to have the working version of the code and you still have your feature to work on.
# You can then merge this to the main branch and they can simply update their code with a git pull.
